Define search keywords that redirect to URLs

== Description ==

With this plugin you can define search keywords that redirect to specified URLs. Some example of usage:

1. Optimizing search to get users to desired content fast.
2. Marketing with search keywords. Much easier for user to remember "search free stuff" than expecting a user to remember/type a URL.
3. Search keyword easter-eggs. Search "guacamole" -> http://mysite.com/awesome-guac-recipe.
4. Fun!
